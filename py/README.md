## Dependencies

I'm not sure exactly which ones are part of the standard library, but the ones that seem less standard have been moved to the top of the list for your sake. It has been tested with Python 2.7, but 2.6 should probably work as well.

* mutagen
* google.protobuf
* json
* optparse
* urllib
* getpass
* httplib
* uuid
* socket
* random
* string
* os
* time

Those using Ubuntu can probably install the dependencies with `sudo apt-get install python-mutagen python-protobuf`

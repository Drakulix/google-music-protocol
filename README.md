This is the new home of research involving reverse-engineering the Google Music protocol, specifically, the uploading mechanism since most other parts are somewhat trivial.

##Authentication

This is the first thing the client does.

```
POST https://www.google.com/accounts/ClientLogin HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Music Manager (1, 0, 24, 7712 - Windows)
Host: www.google.com
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 76
```

It's a POST request done over HTTPS with this content

```
Email=username%40gmail.com&Passwd=thisisntactuallymypassword&service=sj&accountType=GOOGLE
```

Also an interesting tidbit, the `service=sj` thing. At first I thought it was stood for steve jobs, but that wouldn't make too much sense. I had it stuck in the back of my mind for a bit and then it struck me while looking at the uploadsj part of the URL. I think it's short for "skyjam", the internal code name for Google Music.

The server thinks it's okay and then says.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Cache-control: no-cache, no-store
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: Mon, 01-Jan-1990 00:00:00 GMT
Date: Tue, 31 Jan 2012 18:55:59 GMT
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Length: 881
Server: GSE
```

This responds with the SID=, LSID=, Auth= cookie values delimited by newlines.

```
SID=DQAAREDACTEDkV3izSm
LSID=DQAAAMMREDACTEDLLorHpA
Auth=DQAAREDACTEDep1i-o
```

There's also a trailing newline, if that matters. 

##/upsj/upauth

`POST https://android.clients.google.com/upsj/upauth HTTP/1.1`

To be continued, first I have to deem whether or not this is actually necessary for the process. Ostensibly, the only thing this does is send a protobuf-encoded list of the computer's magic address and its hostname. The server responds with a series of numbers denoting some kind of state.

Current Theory: This is in fact necessary. 

##/upsj/clientstate

`POST https://android.clients.google.com/upsj/clientstate HTTP/1.1`

To be continued

Current Theory: This isn't necessary.

This seems to send that magical address thing, this time with the last character substituted with a \n for no apparent reason (and nothing else).

The server responds with that same series of cryptic numbers denoting state as well as what I believe to be the number current upload quota state.

```
8 {
  1: 20000 //maximum number of songs that can be held for your current payment plan
  2: 1696 //total number of songs you have uploaded?
  3: 1402 //available songs (what does that mean?)
}
```

Also, rather interestingly, replaying the message yields an ugly "Your client does not have permission to get URL `/upsj/clientstate` from this server" message, but if you instead send the file which was intended for /upsj/upauth, everything works fine.

Update: It seems that this is the product of the substitution of the last character of the data with a newline, possibly at Fiddler's end.

##/upsj/metadata?version=1

This is where the actual action begins.

Here's a basic overview of what I've gleaned of this process. The client sends a list of tracks which are to be uploaded, this includes all the ID3 metadata, and importantly, a random 22 character alphanumeric temporary ID. In response, the server returns a list which maps each of these temporary IDs, with a persistant track ID which is later used to actually upload stuff and to reference files.

This is a piece of nice, human-readable JSON taken from the web interface API.
